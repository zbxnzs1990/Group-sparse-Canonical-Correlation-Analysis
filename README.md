# Group-sparse-Canonical-Correlation-Analysis
Group sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (group sparse CCA) is a method designed to study the mutual relationship between two different types of data (i.e. SNP and gene expression). More information about method and algorithm can be seen from:   Dongdong Lin, Ji-Gang Zhang, Jingyao Li, Vince D. Calhoun, Hong-Wen Deng, Yu-Ping Wang: Group sparse canonical correlation analysis for genomic data integration. BMC Bioinformatics 14: 245 (2013)
